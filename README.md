This repository contains a set of tools and helpers for deploying self-hosted applications (mostly docker compose files and instructions).

## Applications list
1. [`arr-stack`](arr-stack) - docker compose setup for the official images for the *arr stack: [radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr), [sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr), [jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) and [flaresolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr)
2. [`jenkins`](jenkins) - docker compose setup for a simple jenkins stack with a controller and an agent that runs the jobs (CI/CD). This is build based on the documentation available at [jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md). The agent is custom made - it is given access to docker on the host machine (DooS - to run builds in containers and be able to deploy) and can run `make` commands
